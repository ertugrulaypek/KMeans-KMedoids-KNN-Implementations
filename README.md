# KMeans-KMedoids-KNN
# ColorQuantizer

Implementation of simplified versions of scikit-learn's KMeans, KMedoids and KNN. And a color quantizer with the use of KMeans.

An example of input and output is given. Output is not close to the original image since 
max_iter(20) and chosen number of random RGB values from input image(1000) are very low.
